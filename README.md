Connecticut is generally thought of as a wealthy state. For instance, we have higher average incomes, and lower rates of poverty than the US.

But not everyone in Connecticut has access to these resources. Even these simple measures aren't so simple. White residents, particularly white men, have much higher incomes than other residents.

Black and Latinx residents are more than 3 times as likely to live in poverty than white residents.

And while overall unemployment has gone back down since the Great Recession, some groups started out with high unemployment, and haven't yet recovered.

One third of Connecticut adults report feeling financially insecure, but this again differs by race and sex: nearly half of Black adults report financial insecurity.

We see these same disparities across many measures of financial security.

One way of building financial stability is through homeownership, but few Black or Latinx households own their home.

Households led by married couples are much more likely to own their home than those led by a single adult, but this varies by race as well.

Younger adults are much less likely to own their homes, but even as they get older, Black and Latinx households often miss out on this means of financial stability.

Both race and household type play into whether a household is severely cost-burdened, or paying more than 50% of their income toward housing costs.

Connecticut is rich in resources, but we don't all have access to them. How can we ensure financial stability for all our residents?
